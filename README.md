## Description
The remittances API has been created with the Python framework, Flask. It consists of 3 operations (receiver, history and phones), with a total of 8 endpoints. The complete documentation can be found at Stoplight: ![here](https://themachines.stoplight.io/docs/remittances-as-a-service/)

Its REST -Representational State Transfer- architectural design allows to connect several systems based on the HTTP protocol using standard verbs (GET, POST, PUT andDELETE) to query or generate data, and return the queried data in a standard format such as JSON.
